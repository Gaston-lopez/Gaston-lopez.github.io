      <description>State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have the potential to correct market failures, but they are also subject to the influence of politics and interest groups. We examine this trade-off in the context of the nationalization of the leading gasoline company in Argentina. Descriptive analysis suggests that pricing patterns changed after the nationalization. First, the government exerted less market power, charging lower prices on average and benefiting consumers. Second, it engaged in less economic price discrimination, reducing the correlation between prices and consumers&amp;rsquo; willingness to pay. Third, it engaged in political price discrimination, charging lower prices in provinces with political connections with the state-owned firm. Motivated by these findings, we develop and estimate a model of gasoline supply and demand under market power and recover the government&amp;rsquo;s objective function. We find that public provision lead to welfare gains but is also associated with redistributive motives. Compared to a benevolent planner that internalizes the welfare of all consumers and firms equally, the government set prices as if it only cares about favoring middle-income consumers and consumers in provinces that have political ties with the firm. Lastly, we use the model to assess the company’s response to policy alternatives, including pricing rules that align government actions with the public interest and are in place in government agencies worldwide. Our findings show that rules effectively reduce the influence of politics in pricing but are associated with higher costs: they mitigate half of the welfare gains generated by the nationalization and increase the taxpayers&amp;rsquo; burden by 10%. These findings emphasize the importance of politics and interest groups in shaping governments&amp;rsquo; decision-making process and the role of SOEs as instruments for redistribution.</description>

      <title>Reducing Consumer Inertia in Tobacco Markets</title>

      <description>We study the equilibrium effects of tobacco control policies. Despite decades-long efforts to discour- age smoking, the tobacco industry remains resilient. One of the main reasons is consumers’ attachment to the products they smoke, which we call consumer inertia. We explore two reasons consumers are attached to their products: they get addicted to nicotine and develop lasting brand loyalty to their prod- ucts. Recently, regulators have proposed some policies that would eliminate the addictive components of cigarettes and others that make consumers less loyal to their brands. Although such policies would directly impact consumers, we must understand firms’ responses to assess their impact on consumption. Consumer inertia introduces dynamic incentives for the firms since future demand depends on current choices. As a result, consumers become a valuable asset for the firm, which modifies how they price, introduce, and discontinue products. To assess the empirical effect of reducing inertia in tobacco mar- kets, we develop a model that accounts for consumers and firm responses: consumers have addiction and loyalty, and firms choose prices and product portfolios. We estimate the model leveraging rich variation from the Uruguayan industry and solve the dynamic game for multiple counterfactual levels of inertia. We find that firms’ responses are unlikely to reverse the direct effect on consumers, even though lowering inertia makes customers more price-responsive and can facilitate entry. Decreasing inertia also discour- ages firms from lowering prices to attract customers, which acts as a countervailing force to increased competition and product availability. Even when the policies do backfire, the effect on consumption remains small because of this offsetting force.</description>

      <description>Working Papers How Do Governments Engage in Price Discrimination? Evidence from a Large-Scale Nationalization (with Francisco Pareschi)
Abstract State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have the potential to correct market failures, but they are also subject to the influence of politics and interest groups. We examine this trade-off in the context of the nationalization of the leading gasoline company in Argentina. Descriptive analysis suggests that pricing patterns changed after the nationalization.
