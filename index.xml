      <title>Do Governments Engage in Price Discrimination? Evidence from a Nationalization in Argentina</title>

      <description>State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have the potential to correct market failures, but they are also subject to the influence of politics and interest groups. We study this trade-off in the context of the nationalization of the leading gasoline company in Argentina. Descriptive analysis suggests that pricing patterns changed after the nationalization. First, the government charged lower markups on average, exerting less market power. Second, it engaged in less economic price discrimination, reducing the correlation between prices and consumers&amp;rsquo; willingness to pay. Third, it engaged in political price discrimination, charging lower prices in provinces that have political connexions with the firm. Motivated by these findings, we develop and estimate a model of supply and demand of gasoline under market power and recover the government&amp;rsquo;s objective function. We find that public provision leads to welfare gains but is also associated with redistributive motives. In comparison to a benevolent planner that internalizes the welfare of all consumers and firms equally, the government chooses prices as if it only cares about consumers in provinces with political ties with the firms and middle-income consumers in all provinces. Lastly, we use the model to assess the firm&amp;rsquo;s response to policy alternatives, including rules that limit discretion in decision-making and echo existing regulations in government agencies worldwide. We find that rules effectively reduce the influence of politics in pricing but are associated with higher costs: they mitigate half of the welfare gains generated by the nationalization and increase the tax-payers burden by 10%. These findings shed light on the complexities of public provision, emphasizing the importance of politics and interest groups in shaping governments&amp;rsquo; actions and the role of SOEs as instruments for redistribution.</description>

      <title>Reducing Consumer Inertia in Tobacco Markets</title>

      <description>Despite decades-long efforts to discourage smoking, the tobacco industry remains resilient partly due to consumers’ physical and psychological dependence. Recently, regulators have proposed nicotine caps and standardized packaging, known to decrease addiction and loyalty, the two primary sources of inertia in the market. In response, tobacco companies argue that lowering inertia will intensify price competi- tion, making cheaper alternatives available and raising consumption. We study the impact of reducing addiction and loyalty on cigarette consumption. To analyze this problem, we develop a dynamic model of price competition under inertia that considers firms’ product assortment. We adopt a computationally efficient equilibrium solution to make it empirically tractable and use rich variation from the Uruguayan tobacco market to estimate its primitives. We argue that equilibrium effects depend on how firms balance their incentives to capture new customers and profit from existing ones. If by reducing inertia, firms’ incentives to attract new consumers decrease enough; then prices might increase instead. Indeed, we show that sizable drops in brand loyalty lead to higher prices. Even if firms lower prices, the direct effect on consumers might dominate, as in the case of lowering addiction. Finally, we illustrate that eliminating inertia increases tax efficacy to deter consumption. In our context, taxes discourage firms from expand- ing their customer base, leading to higher tax pass-through. Hence, by lowering inertia firms pass less of the tax to customers. We contend this is positive for governments because they can reduce smoking prevalence while sacrificing less revenue.</description>
