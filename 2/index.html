<title>Reducing Consumer Inertia in Tobacco Markets | </title>
<meta name="keywords" content="">
<meta name="description" content="Despite decades-long efforts to discourage smoking, the tobacco industry remains resilient partly due to consumers’ physical and psychological dependence. Recently, regulators have proposed nicotine caps and standardized packaging, known to decrease addiction and loyalty, the two primary sources of inertia in the market. In response, tobacco companies argue that lowering inertia will intensify price competi- tion, making cheaper alternatives available and raising consumption. We study the impact of reducing addiction and loyalty on cigarette consumption. To analyze this problem, we develop a dynamic model of price competition under inertia that considers firms’ product assortment. We adopt a computationally efficient equilibrium solution to make it empirically tractable and use rich variation from the Uruguayan tobacco market to estimate its primitives. We argue that equilibrium effects depend on how firms balance their incentives to capture new customers and profit from existing ones. If by reducing inertia, firms’ incentives to attract new consumers decrease enough; then prices might increase instead. Indeed, we show that sizable drops in brand loyalty lead to higher prices. Even if firms lower prices, the direct effect on consumers might dominate, as in the case of lowering addiction. Finally, we illustrate that eliminating inertia increases tax efficacy to deter consumption. In our context, taxes discourage firms from expand- ing their customer base, leading to higher tax pass-through. Hence, by lowering inertia firms pass less of the tax to customers. We contend this is positive for governments because they can reduce smoking prevalence while sacrificing less revenue.">

<p>Despite decades-long efforts to discourage smoking, the tobacco industry remains resilient partly due to consumers’ physical and psychological dependence. Recently, regulators have proposed nicotine caps and standardized packaging, known to decrease addiction and loyalty, the two primary sources of inertia in the market. In response, tobacco companies argue that lowering inertia will intensify price competi- tion, making cheaper alternatives available and raising consumption. We study the impact of reducing addiction and loyalty on cigarette consumption. To analyze this problem, we develop a dynamic model of price competition under inertia that considers firms’ product assortment. We adopt a computationally efficient equilibrium solution to make it empirically tractable and use rich variation from the Uruguayan tobacco market to estimate its primitives. We argue that equilibrium effects depend on how firms balance their incentives to capture new customers and profit from existing ones. If by reducing inertia, firms&rsquo; incentives to attract new consumers decrease enough; then prices might increase instead. Indeed, we show that sizable drops in brand loyalty lead to higher prices. Even if firms lower prices, the direct effect on consumers might dominate, as in the case of lowering addiction. Finally, we illustrate that eliminating inertia increases tax efficacy to deter consumption. In our context, taxes discourage firms from expand- ing their customer base, leading to higher tax pass-through. Hence, by lowering inertia firms pass less of the tax to customers. We contend this is positive for governments because they can reduce smoking prevalence while sacrificing less revenue.</p>
