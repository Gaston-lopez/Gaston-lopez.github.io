Our study responds to the Federal Drug Administration and the World Health Organization&rsquo;s initiatives to decrease consumer state dependence through nicotine caps and plain packaging.

We then leverage unique variation from the Uruguayan tobacco industry to show that both addiction and brand loyalty are relevant, and that firms consider consumers&rsquo; inertia while making business decisions. Finally, we show that modest drops in consumer state dependence from our baseline estimates tend to decrease prices and increase aggregate consumption.

<p>We explore the effects of reducing addiction and brand loyalty on tobacco consumption. Our study responds to the Federal Drug Administration and the World Health Organization&rsquo;s initiatives to decrease consumer state dependence through nicotine caps and plain packaging. Our research shows that policies aiming at reducing consumer state dependence can backfire by increasing consumption through lower prices and making taxes less effective at reducing smoking prevalence. To reach this conclusion, we first develop a novel model of dynamic price competition that considers entry, exit, and consumer inertia. Crucially, we illustrate how to make this model empirically tractable by adopting a computationally efficient equilibrium solution. Solving the model for several consumer inertia parameters, we note that the relationship between inertia and consumption is non-monotonic and concave. We then leverage unique variation from the Uruguayan tobacco industry to show that both addiction and brand loyalty are relevant, and that firms consider consumers&rsquo; inertia while making business decisions. Finally, we show that modest drops in consumer state dependence from our baseline estimates tend to decrease prices and increase aggregate consumption.
